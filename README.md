## Stats 111 HW \#5

Taken from one of the last classes I took for my minor in statistics, this project features the analysis of a data set of Portugeuse secondary students (raw data in ```student-mat.csv```) with the aim of evaluating how certain student traits correlate with a student's desire to attend higher education. The ```R``` code analyzing this data is in ```Stats_111_HW_5.R``` while the final report produced for this assignment is available in ```Stats_111_HW_5_Report.tex```.
